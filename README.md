# 3BitterNights
Okay so this is the code of Three Bitter Nights
The code is not public yet, but ironically it is coded in javascript, specifically THREE(.js)
and as of my knowledge, no one has ever made a fangame in javascript let alone THREE.js so I'm gonna explain basically everything about how the game works because I don't think most people will be able to understand
this mess of code
