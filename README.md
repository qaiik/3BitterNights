# 3BitterNights
Okay so this is the code of Three Bitter Nights

The code is not public yet, but ironically it is coded in javascript, specifically THREE(.js)

and as of my knowledge, no one has ever made a fangame in javascript let alone THREE.js 

So I'm gonna explain basically everything about how the game works because I don't think most people will be able to understand
this mess of code

95% of this code is rendering because THREE.js is a very code heavy library and setting up an empty scene takes around 60 lines.
If this project goes well I will adapt the code and make a FNAF 3d Engine called NNight 

I am trying to make the code as modular and organized as possible but it will still be a mess so just keep that in mind
